## Course Description

The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundation in informatics, an interdisciplinary area fusing computer science, programming, and data analysis skills used to solve problems in any field, particularly the natural sciences, business, and the arts. This course also provides an opportunity for students to explore their interest in topics that are central to the Bachelor of Science in Informatics, Computer Science, and Applied Computer Science programs, and therefore be more informed in considering further study in one of these programs.

The course emphasizes broadly applicable skills in informatics that are applicable to many areas, so it is appropriate for students with an interest in applying informatics to an area of their own interest. The course will emphasize the Liberal Studies Essential Skill of quantitative reasoning by developing programs that apply numerical analyses to various data sets, followed by drawing inferences on the meaning of the analytic results to phenomena drawn from population health and ecological modeling. Furthermore, by focusing on foundational concepts central to informatics, the use of informatics-driven problem-solving methods, and the application of informatics to better understand and solve problems that benefit human and environmental health, the course also provides the necessary elements to satisfy NAU Liberal Studies requirements in the Science and Applied Science distribution block.

## Prerequisites or Corequisites
* MAT 125 or MAT 125H with grade of C or better or Math Placement Test Results (ALEKS/MATHA 50+; MATHC 50+; PLACE 55+).</br>
* The course does not require any prior experience in programming and is intended for students of any background and major.

## Course Schedule
This is a tentative outline and topics may vary according to student needs. The course will be delivered in person, but can be done remotely if quarantines are required. Attendance is strongly encouraged as there will be live coding demonstrations. It is important to be flexible in response to the changes the COVID-19 pandemic has made to the rhythm of our lives. 
* All quizzes and homeworks for a given week are due on Sunday 11:59 PM.
