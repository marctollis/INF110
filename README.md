  This course provides learning opportunities in the foundations of informatics, an interdisciplinary area fusing computer science, programming, and data analysis skills used to solve problems in any field, particularly the natural sciences, business, and the arts. This course will particularly focus on problems drawn from areas that provide significant benefits to human and environmental health. The course does not require any prior experience in programming and is intended for students of any background and major. This course also provides an opportunity for students to explore their interest in topics that are central to the Bachelor of Science in Informatics, Computer Science, and Applied Computer Science programs, and therefore be more informed in considering further study in one of these programs.

  The course emphasizes broadly applicable skills in informatics that are applicable to many areas, so it is appropriate for students with an interest in applying informatics to an area of their own interest. The course will emphasize the Liberal Studies Essential Skill of quantitative reasoning by developing programs that apply numerical analyses to various data sets, followed by drawing inferences on the meaning of the analytic results to phenomena drawn from population health and ecological modeling. Furthermore, by focusing on foundational concepts central to informatics, the use of informatics-driven problem-solving methods, and the application of informatics to better understand and solve problems that benefit human and environmental health, the course also provides the necessary elements to satisfy NAU Liberal Studies requirements in the Science and Applied Science distribution block.
